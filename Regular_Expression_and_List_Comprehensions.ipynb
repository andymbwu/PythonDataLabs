      "\n",
      "THE OLDEST BRITISH COLONY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It would not be an exaggeration to say that Newfoundland, although\n",
      "it is the most ancient of the British Colonies, is less known and\n",
      "understood in Great Britain than any of her oversea possessions. It\n",
      "is generally believed that Newfoundland is somewhere in the Arctic\n",
      "Circle; that the inhabitants are clothed in furs, live in snow huts,\n",
      "feed on codfish; and that for six months of the year the island is\n",
      "unapproachable on account of barriers of ice and impenetrable fogs.\n",
      "This is altogether untrue.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you consult a map of British North America, you will see that\n",
      "Newfoundland is an island a little to the north-east of Nova Scotia, in\n",
      "Canada. It stretches right across to the entrance of the Gulf of St.\n",
      "Lawrence, its south-western projection being only sixty miles from Cape\n",
      "Breton, from which point Canadians may reach the island in about six\n",
      "hours by crossing the Cabot Straits. The eastern coast of Newfoundland\n",
      "is 1,640 miles from Ireland, and the fastest “liner” crossing the\n",
      "Atlantic would cover the journey in from three to four days, although\n",
      "the steamships at present plying between Great Britain and the Colony\n",
      "are usually seven days accomplishing the voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon first looking at the map of the Colony, you are at once impressed\n",
      "by the similarity of its physical features to England or Scotland. If\n",
      "you were to cut off the two peninsulas at the south-east corner, from\n",
      "Trinity Bay to Fortune Bay, the remaining land would not be at all\n",
      "unlike England.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coast of Newfoundland is extremely rugged, and you will get an\n",
      "idea of the number and size of the bays if you bear in mind that the\n",
      "coast-line at present, measured from headland to headland, is about\n",
      "1,000 miles; whereas, if the bays were straightened out, there would be\n",
      "a coast-line of probably 2,000 miles. Some of the bays are very deep,\n",
      "and the huge, high rocks towering above them present a picturesque and\n",
      "majestic appearance. There is, perhaps, no country in the world that\n",
      "has such secure natural harbours. These land-locked harbours are a\n",
      "great boon to the fishermen, for when the long, rolling waves of the\n",
      "Atlantic are eager to devour any vessels that may be in their way, the\n",
      "slender craft of the fishermen are securely nestled between a couple of\n",
      "immovable jutting headlands.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a map of North America Newfoundland usually looks very small. Of\n",
      "course, in comparison with the United States and Canada, it is small.\n",
      "An idea of its size is best obtained by comparing it with Ireland, than\n",
      "which country it is said to be about one-fifth larger. Its breadth\n",
      "is about fifty miles greater than England, and its length 140 miles\n",
      "less. About one-fourth of the island’s surface is covered by water,\n",
      "so that one naturally expects to see many rivers, lakes, and ponds.\n",
      "Three large rivers are the Gander, the Exploits, and the Humber, all of\n",
      "which are teeming with what are considered to be the finest salmon in\n",
      "the world. Every summer British and American tourists flock to these\n",
      "rivers, for not only can excellent fishing be obtained, but absolute\n",
      "quiet and magnificent scenery are always to be enjoyed by those who\n",
      "seek sport, health, and rest from the dust and din of ordinary workaday\n",
      "life. Lakes, too, are very numerous, and to view sixty to seventy of\n",
      "them from the summit of a mountain is a scene never to be forgotten\n",
      "by the beholder. As these lakes are invariably surrounded by spruce\n",
      "and fir trees, their existence may never be known to the traveller\n",
      "unless he happen to be on some eminence far above the common track of\n",
      "the ordinary pedestrian. One striking feature in connection with many\n",
      "of the lakes is the secluded hollows in which they are to be found on\n",
      "the tops of the high hills, as though they had determined that their\n",
      "beauty should not be enjoyed without the effort of climbing on the part\n",
      "of the seeker of placid waters. When the climber reaches the crest\n",
      "of a high hill, it is quite a common experience to be unexpectedly\n",
      "confronted by a circle of water, from which scores of seagulls rise,\n",
      "startled by the intrusion of a stranger upon their solitary retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there are no very lofty mountains in the island, there are\n",
      "numerous ranges of high hills, the Long Range extending for quite 200\n",
      "miles in a north-easterly direction from Cape Ray. In the winter the\n",
      "hills present a beautiful appearance, with their innumerable white\n",
      "heads peering above the clumps of spruce and fir trees, the charm of\n",
      "the bright blue being greatly enhanced by the contrast. But they are\n",
      "most beautiful in autumn, when the undergrowth begins to change its\n",
      "colour, and the leaves of the wild berries put on their glamorous robes\n",
      "of scarlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as a chapter will be devoted to the scenery of this ancient\n",
      "island, we will pass on to an account of the early races, together with\n",
      "the present inhabitants, their mode, of living and the means by which\n",
      "they obtain a livelihood.\n",

      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "\n",
      "THE INHABITANTS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is always something interesting in an account of the early\n",
      "inhabitants of a country; but, unfortunately, it is not possible to\n",
      "trace the first dwellers upon the soil of Britain’s ancient Colony of\n",
      "Newfoundland. There is much tradition associated with the researches\n",
      "of historians, and very few descriptions of the races inhabiting this\n",
      "large island in the early ages can be considered at all authentic.\n",
      "The Red Indians can be traced with accuracy so long ago as 1497, when\n",
      "Cabot, the celebrated navigator and explorer, found his way to the\n",
      "great stretches of fertile lands on the north-west of the Atlantic\n",
      "Ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "This race of Red Indians were known as the Beothiks. Doubtless they\n",
      "were a warlike people, and had their tribal battles, just as did the\n",
      "various tribes once so numerous in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and\n",
      "other parts of Canada. Their chief occupations would be hunting and\n",
      "fishing, for the island abounded in geese, wild-duck, ptarmigan,\n",
      "bears, foxes, and deer, whilst the rivers were abundantly stocked with\n",
      "beaver, as well as salmon, trout, and numerous other kinds of fishes.\n",
      "The weapons with which they captured their prey would be clubs, bows\n",
      "and arrows, spears, and slings, so that they would never be in need\n",
      "of food, and the furs of the wild animals would furnish them with all\n",
      "necessary clothing to keep them warm in the long, cold days of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Guy, who is supposed to be the first Englishman to successfully\n",
      "found a settlement in Newfoundland, describes the Beothiks as he found\n",
      "them in 1612: “They are of a reasonable stature, of an ordinary middle\n",
      "size. They goe bare-headed, wearing their hair somewhat long, but\n",
      "round; they haue no Beards; behind they have a great locke of haire\n",
      "platted with feathers, like a Hawkes Lure, with a feather standing in\n",
      "it vpright by the crowne of the head, and a small locke platted before;\n",
      "a short gown made of stags skins, the Furre innermost, that ranne down\n",
      "to the middle of their arme, and a Beauer skinne about their necke was\n",
      "all their apparell, saue that one of them had shooes and mittens, so\n",
      "that all went bare-legged and most bare-foote. They are full-eyed, of a\n",
      "blacke colour; the colour of their haire was diuers, some blacke, some\n",
      "browne and some yellow, and their faces something flat and broad, red\n",
      "with Oker, as all their apparell is, and the rest of their body; they\n",
      "are broad-brested, and bould, and stand very vpright.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Beothiks, however, were so cruelly treated by another tribe called\n",
      "Micmacs, and more particularly by French and English settlers, that by\n",
      "1829 the last of this interesting race passed away in the person of\n",
      "Shawnandithit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present inhabitants are mostly of English, Irish, and Scotch\n",
      "descent, and number about 227,000. When it is borne in mind that the\n",
      "area of the island is 42,000 square miles, it will be seen how small\n",
      "the population is. St. John’s, the capital of Newfoundland, has a\n",
      "population of about 30,000. The rest of the inhabitants are scattered\n",
      "along the coasts. Comparatively few people dwell in the interior.\n",
      "Probably one-fourth of the people are engaged in the fishery, as this\n",
      "is the leading industry of the Colony. The fisher-folk live very simple\n",
      "and, on the whole, honest lives. They live chiefly on fish, tea, pork,\n",
      "and bread. Their houses are built of wood, and are usually erected by\n",
      "the tenants themselves. One could not call the fisher-folk educated,\n",
      "and it would be unjust to call them illiterate. To-day the Government\n",
      "are devoting more attention to education, and in a few years’ time the\n",
      "fisherman who cannot read or write will be looked upon as a curiosity.\n",
      "The children in the out-ports are receiving an education to-day in\n",
      "their own districts that their fathers could have obtained only by\n",
      "attending the schools of the larger towns. Even so recently as twenty\n",
      "years ago the fishermen in some of the settlements exchanged their\n",
      "fish for food and clothing, money not being in general circulation.\n",
      "The rate of mortality in some of the settlements is very high, which\n",
      "is due to the hardships of their calling, poor food, and small and\n",

      "to face the perils of the sea. And through what perils the poor\n",
      "fishermen have to pass! Wind, rain, fog, snow, and ice sweep over\n",
      "the fishing-grounds, carrying many a slender craft far out to sea,\n",

      "As one example of many similar experiences, the following account of\n",
      "thirty-six hours at sea in a hurricane during November, 1909, will\n",
      "illustrate the perils endured in the waters around the Newfoundland\n",
      "coast. The schooner _Fannie Belle_ was on her way to St. John’s with\n",
      "a cargo of fish and oil. When near to Cape Ballard a strong breeze\n",
      "forced the schooner to bear away under double-reefed foresail; but\n",

      "and spend the night under the shadow of that sheltering headland. By\n",
      "the time the first faint streaks of light had appeared in the eastern\n",
      "sky, the wind had risen to a hurricane, and the crew were not surprised\n",
      "when the anchors suddenly parted, and the schooner, borne on the crest\n",
      "of a giant wave, was plunged into a mountainous sea, her anchors being\n",
      "dragged along as though they were no stronger than strips of seaweed.\n",
      "All day long she fought a battle against terrible odds. The captain\n",
      "and the crew strained every muscle to keep her above water, and every\n",
      "moment they expected to go down to the bottom of the sea. The schooner\n",
      "had drifted fifty miles out to sea, and was most of the time on her\n",
      "beam ends. The tossing of the ship had kept the barrels of oil rolling\n",
      "from port to starboard all the day, and only the nimble movements of\n",
      "the crew saved them from broken limbs or death. The captain, who was\n",
      "lashed to the wheel, saw that these rolling casks would pound the ship\n",
      "to pieces, so he ordered eighteen of them to be thrown overboard. A\n",
      "few moments afterwards the jumbo and mainsail were torn in shreds, and\n",
      "the dory on deck was swept into the sea. The riding-sail was then set,\n",
      "and the captain kept her running with the wind. But the hurricane\n",
      "increased, and the schooner began to take in a lot of water. Eighty\n",
      "quintals of fish were thrown overboard, and the pumps were set to work.\n",
      "Distress signals were hoisted, but they were unnoticed by two passing\n",
      "steamers. The snow, fog, and flying spray probably hid the small ship\n",
      "from the larger, ones. A little girl, daughter of one of the crew, was\n",
      "confined in the cabin; but so accustomed are the fishermen’s children\n",
      "to the perils of the sea that she felt just as much at home in the\n",
      "storm as in the calm. The crew were kept busy for thirty-six hours\n",
      "fighting against fearful odds, and when they were towed into Trepassey\n",
      "every man was exhausted, but more than thankful that they had escaped\n",
      "a watery grave. Everything had been washed from the deck, even the iron\n",
      "chains, and for fifteen hours, without food, the captain had been\n",
      "lashed securely to the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "These perilous adventures on the sea make the fishermen very brave\n",
      "and self-reliant; they make them very kind-hearted too. If a ship is\n",
      "in distress, they are always ready to risk their lives in an attempt\n",
      "to save the lives on board. It is not an uncommon occurrence for some\n",

      "of this steamship might never have been known had not one of the\n",
      "inhabitants accidentally caught sight of the wreckage in the crannies\n",
      "of the cliffs. When it was once reported that a wreck had taken place,\n",

      "might yet be of some service to the passengers and crew. Alas! nothing\n",
      "remained but dead bodies and fragments of the ill-fated ship. From the\n",
      "top of the cliff two men were lowered by a rope into the abyss below.\n",
      "What a ghastly sight greeted them! After hours of strenuous work, they\n",
      "managed to draw twenty dead bodies from the sea, and securing them one\n",

      "with pieces of canvas and carpet from the wreckage, and reverently\n",
      "laid the bodies in it side by side to rest in a lonely grave, where\n",
      "the Atlantic can do no more than cast over them the spray of its angry\n",

      "loved ones were mourning for those whom they would see no more.\n",

      "God-fearing man and one who had great faith in prayer, so he called the\n",

      "special service of prayer to ask God to send them fish on the following\n",
      "day. All the fishermen of the village except one attended the service.\n",
      "During the service the minister called on several of the fishermen\n",
      "to pray that God would send fish; but some of them got away from the\n",
      "subject and prayed for everything except fish. “Stick to fish,” cried\n",
      "the minister. “We want fish, and we must pray for it.” At the close\n",
      "of the service the men walked home, many of them doubting, others\n",
      "believing. Ned Williams, the atheist of the village, laughed at the\n",
      "idea of prayer being answered. And yet, strange as it may seem, Ned was\n",
      "the first to go out in his boat next morning, and before he had been\n",
      "fishing five minutes he was hauling fish into his boat by the score.\n",
      "The glad news soon spread through the settlement, and by nightfall\n",

      "Since the days when Cabot left Bristol to roam across the Atlantic\n",
      "in search of new lands and new peoples, the fishing-grounds of the\n",
      "Grand Banks have become known all over the world. Indeed, their\n",
      "riches have been coveted by many countries, and more than one battle\n",
      "has been fought between nation and nation to gain possession of the\n",
      "famous “gold-mine of the Newfoundland fishery, richer than the famous\n",
      "treasures of Golconda and Peru.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several kinds of fishing prosecuted by the fishermen of\n",
      "Newfoundland, but the cod is the most profitable to the Colony, as the\n",
      "catch is usually worth between seven and eight million dollars a year.\n",
      "The fishing-grounds are not confined to the Grand Banks; they stretch\n",
      "from the south along the east and west coasts as far as Labrador.\n",
      "Of course, the waters within a certain distance from the shore are\n",
      "the exclusive property of Newfoundland so far as fishing in them is\n",
      "concerned; but Americans, Canadians, Frenchmen, and Newfoundlanders\n",
      "may cast their lines into the water on the Grand Banks. If you were\n",
      "to ask a scientist why these teeming millions of cod congregate in\n",
      "this part of the sea, he would tell you that the water is crowded with\n",
      "various species of jelly-fish, and these delicacies are the favourite\n",
      "food of the cod.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: DRYING FISH ON THE “FISH FLAKES.”]\n",
      "\n",
      "As the cod-fishery is the staple industry of Newfoundland, and as it is\n",
      "both in extent of area and wealth of production the largest cod-fishery\n",
      "in the world, it is interesting to know something about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our knowledge of the habits of fishes,” says a writer on this subject,\n",
      "“is yet extremely limited. Naturally, we cannot follow them through\n",
      "the waters, and in consequence we know very little about them. We are,\n",
      "however, aware that the varied courses of the cod are due to two main\n",
      "causes--the capture of food and the variation of temperature:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scientific investigation has shown us that the great ocean river,\n",
      "known as the ‘Labrador Current,’ which sweeps past the east coast of\n",
      "Newfoundland (the most valuable of our fishing-grounds), is one vast\n",
      "moving mass of fish food, full of minute crustaceans and animalculæ,\n",
      "which afford abundant nourishment for seals, whales, and fish of all\n",
      "kinds. The surrounding, with its ever-abundant supply of bait--fishes,\n",
      "caplin, squid, and herring--and its suitable temperature, therefore\n",
      "affords an ideal home for the cod.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The stability and regularity about the incoming of the cod, and the\n",
      "consequent permanent character of this great fishery, proved by the\n",
      "experience of our centuries, without one single failure, is very marked\n",
      "when we compare it with its rival industry, the herring fishery.\n",
      "Herrings, for causes unknown, left the coasts of Norway for one hundred\n",
      "years. Nearer Newfoundland, the great Labrador herring fishery is now\n",
      "practically extinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With respect to the movement of the cod there are two opinions, some\n",
      "maintaining that the fish remain in each bay, only in winter they\n",
      "retire to deeper water. This fact is proved by their capture in those\n",
      "localities in deep water; but the other view, that there are two large\n",
      "and extensive movements, is also clearly shown by various facts, the\n",
      "capture of cod on our coasts with French hooks attached to them proving\n",
      "that these fish have come in from Grand Bank district over many miles;\n",
      "also the everyday occurrence of the cod and caplin being taken along\n",
      "the Labrador coast later and later as the fishermen proceed north,\n",
      "until near Cape Chidley the voyage is limited to a few weeks’ duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Next to the stability of this great fishery we may note the commercial\n",
      "value of the cod. Different from oily fishes, like the salmon and\n",
      "herring, its flesh is rich and gelatinous, without being fatty, and\n",
      "readily lends itself to a simple and efficient cure by salting and\n",
      "drying in the sun. The cured product is found to be the best of all\n",
      "the deep-sea fishes for use in tropical countries, and has never had a\n",
      "rival. It was imported into Spain and the Mediterranean countries as a\n",
      "staple article of commerce centuries before the discovery of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may add to this comment the remarkable effect of this great fishery\n",
      "on the making of England. It was the cod that first drew Englishmen\n",
      "from the narrow seas, and laid the foundation of her greatness as a\n",
      "maritime power.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The wealth of New England was founded by this fishery, and a stuffed\n",

      "the obligations of the Commonwealth to this humble foundation of their\n",
      "progress and prosperity.”\n",

      "From May to October is the cod-fishing season. The small\n",
      "fishing-smacks, manned by a crew of six or a dozen men, look very\n",
      "picturesque as they lie anchored in the fishing-grounds, with their\n",
      "sails proudly quivering in the breeze. These smacks are equipped\n",
      "with small boats called “dories,” which are frequently sent out some\n",
      "distance from the smacks to make independent catches. At nightfall\n",
      "these dories return with their treasure to the smack. Then begins the\n",
      "work of slitting, cleaning, salting, and packing away in the hold.\n",
      "To see an army of men brandishing their “slitters” over the silver\n",
      "bellies of the fish in the moonlight is one of the weirdest sights\n",
      "imaginable, when viewed from the deck of a passing liner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The herring, salmon, and lobster fisheries are all of more or less\n",
      "importance, and the perils attending the prosecution of the former\n",
      "are many. The herring-fishing industry is subject to fluctuations\n",
      "every season. At one time there was a great trade in the famous\n",
      "Labrador herrings, but this has practically dwindled to nothing.\n",
      "This disappearance of large and well-known schools of herring from\n",
      "the Labrador coast has called forth many explanatory theories. One\n",
      "authority on the subject suggests: “The practice heretofore adopted\n",
      "of barring large masses of herring, causing many dead fish to sink\n",
      "and thereby pollute the ground, is a partial reason, and it is not\n",
      "unreasonable to suppose that the great increase of cod-traps at present\n",
      "used in the Labrador cod-fishery, fencing off much of the coast-line,\n",
      "has had the effect of preventing the herring from entering the bays, as\n",
      "was their wont when the cod-fishery was prosecuted mainly by cod-seines\n",
      "and hook and line. Schools of herring have recently been reported as\n",
      "having been seen by Labrador fishermen, but farther from the land\n",
      "than in former years; and it is not only possible, but probable, that\n",
      "drift-net fishing on that coast would be attended with favourable\n",
      "results, and go to prove that the herring had not really deserted the\n",
      "coast, but were frequenting water clear of the cod-trap obstruction,\n",
      "which may be said to be permanent, as the traps remain in the water\n",
      "both day and night, whereas cod-seines are only used during the day.\n",
      "The migration of the fish, it should be noted, is not an uncommon\n",
      "occurrence in the history of the herring tribe in other countries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting of all the Newfoundland fisheries is\n",

      "The most impressive feature about the railway in Newfoundland is that\n",
      "it should exist at all. Twenty years ago the late Sir Robert Reid began\n",
      "to invade the trackless wilderness with an army of navvies, and in a\n",
      "very short time the iron horses went snorting and panting through the\n",
      "lonely woods and desolate tracts that form the vast interior of the\n",
      "island. Only a great mind could have surmounted the obstacles that\n",
      "confronted the undertaker of so gigantic a scheme. There were mountains\n",
      "and rivers to evade, stretches of water to bridge over, granite rocks\n",
      "to pierce, swampy land and thick forests to avoid, and last, but not\n",
      "least, the selection of a route that should be not only the best\n",
      "commercially, but also the best from the standpoint of picturesqueness.\n",
      "\n",
      "From St. John’s, the starting-point, to Port-aux-Basques, the\n",
      "terminus, is a distance of 548 miles, and the journey is covered\n",
      "in about twenty-eight hours. The track is a narrow gauge, and the\n",
      "engines are not so large as the passenger engines of England; but over\n",
      "many sections of the track a speed of thirty-five miles an hour is\n",
      "attained. The route is very circuitous, some of the curves being so\n",
      "sharp that from your seat in the carriage you can see the engine and\n",
      "the first two or three coaches taking the curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coaches--or cars, as they are called in Newfoundland--are like\n",

      "ten persons, five on each side; nor do you enter from the side of the\n",
      "car. You enter at the end, and take your seat with fifty or sixty other\n",
      "people. There is an aisle down the centre, with seats on either side\n",
      "capable of accommodating two passengers. You can walk down the aisle\n",
      "the full length of the train. There are a dining-car and a sleeping-car\n",
      "attached to the train, and there are also small compartments at one end\n",
      "of the cars reserved for the use of smokers. When the meals are ready\n",
      "in the dining-car, an attendant walks through each car to announce the\n",
      "fact to the passengers. You do not pay so much for the meal, but call\n",
      "for just what your taste requires, and pay for that only.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no ticket-collectors, as in England, whose duty it is to\n",
      "examine or collect your ticket; but, as in America, a man is kept on\n",

      "of the stopping-places as the train approaches them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When bedtime arrives, a coloured man enters your car and pulls down\n",
      "a sort of shelf, which is called an “upper berth,” the “lower berth”\n",
      "being the seats converted into a very comfortable bed. Curtains are\n",
      "drawn in front of your bed, so that you are hidden from the view of\n",
      "the other passengers. If you choose an upper berth, you climb into it\n",
      "by means of a small step-ladder, and then begins that very difficult\n",
      "task of taking your trousers off while lying on your back. It takes a\n",
      "good deal of practice to perform this feat successfully when the train\n",
      "is running along at full speed, and I have known many a traveller give\n",
      "it up in despair, choosing rather to sleep in his pants than attempt\n",
      "the operation. It is no less difficult to put your pants on again next\n",
      "morning, and it is very laughable to see some passenger peeping over\n",
      "the top of his curtain to see if the line is clear, so that he can jump\n",
      "down into the aisle and dress in an upright attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have managed to get your pants and vest on, you go into the\n",
      "compartment at the end of the “sleeper” reserved for washing. This\n",

      "you are washing, you are apt to find yourself thrown on the head of a\n",

      "pulls up, it is probable that your head comes in contact with the\n",

      "however, is shaving while the train is in motion, and if you find a\n",

      "quickly. At intervals the engine pulls up at a water-shed for five\n",
      "or ten minutes, and the passengers all jump off into the tangle of\n",
      "shrubbery to stretch their legs, and, if it is autumn, gather a few\n",

      "vessel, and all knew that a pirate bold was chasing them. To escape was\n",
      "impossible, as the pirate showed herself a much smarter vessel than the\n",
      "merchantman. There was no means of escape from the deadly ship. She was\n",
      "bound for plunder, and therefore neither property nor life would hinder\n",
      "her crew in their villainous work. They knew that the merchant ship was\n",
      "outward bound, and in her lockers would be gold wherewith to purchase\n",

      "\n",
      "After a broadside or two from the pirate the merchant ship hove up, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Our hero was the youngest of the crew, and he looked in horror at the\n",

      "hopeful and buoyant, were all murdered before his eyes, or had been\n",
      "made to walk the plank. Somehow his life was spared, and when the\n",
      "pirates left the ship, they took him as a living prize, in addition to\n",
      "the ill-gotten gold which they had plundered. Thus the young English\n",
      "sailor became one of a pirate’s crew, and for a year or two he\n",
      "witnessed much of their deadly doings. He began to wonder how long he\n",
      "would be held a prisoner, and would a chance offer whereby he would\n",
      "be rescued from his captivity. The ship by which he was captured had\n",
      "made calls at different ports during his stay on board, and the last\n",
      "place she visited was within the headlands of Conception Bay, where the\n",
      "proceeds of their ocean chase, in the form of money and plate, had been\n",
      "buried.\n",

      "It was on one of these occasions that the daring pirate met her own\n",

      "to the bottom. At the place mentioned the booty was hidden, and a few\n",
      "days were taken for the purpose of refitting. This done, the anchors\n",
      "were weighed, and sail was set for another cruise. Just as everything\n",

      "mistake, and realized her own danger, for as the ships neared each\n",
      "other their true colours were seen, and their opposite characters\n",
      "clearly known. One was a pirate, the other a British man-o’-war--a\n",

      "two fishermen informed the boys that they were on the wrong course, and\n",
      "then gave them instructions in which direction they were to row. The\n",

      "they could not hear the familiar sound of the surf driving on the land,\n",
      "there was no alternative but to anchor for the night. Alas! when they\n",

      "he is, with his soft, brown, sympathetic eyes, shining black coat,\n",
      "strong-set legs, and commanding head! How the children love him! And\n",
      "how he loves the children! It is a common sight to see him harnessed,\n",

      "the joyous wag of his tail, and his proud walk, that he appreciates the\n",
      "task of drawing his infant queen through the country lanes when she is\n",
      "taking her morning constitutional. In the winter-time he enters fully\n",
      "into the pastimes of the boys and girls, and enjoys a frolic in the\n",
      "snow just as much as they. When the lakes are frozen over, and the snow\n",
      "lies hard upon the ground, “Bobby” is harnessed to a little sleigh, and\n",

      "so much improved that they are now accepted as the most sagacious\n",

      "King Edward VII. made his famous tour in 1860, he was presented with\n",
      "a Newfoundland dog, and he valued the gift very highly. Another dog\n",
      "was also presented to the present King at the close of the nineteenth\n",

      "sprung up another type of dog, lacking the sagacity and beauty of the\n",
      "original, and displaying a ferocity which sometimes strikes terror into\n",
      "the hearts of Newfoundlanders. Frequently these dogs are to be seen\n",
      "in the daytime lying in a group in the forests, waiting for nightfall\n",
      "in order to raid the sheep-folds and fowl-roosts of the vicinity.\n",

      "relate scores of incidents where boys and girls have been saved from\n",

      "story is one among many others:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Martin was the son of a fisherman, and he lived on the north shore\n",
      "of Conception Bay. His father had been drowned while seal-hunting, and\n",
      "so Tom was the only support of his mother and two little sisters. He\n",
      "had a favourite Newfoundland dog, named Bob, and wherever you saw Tom\n",
      "you were certain to see Bob, except in the little dory that Tom used\n",
      "to fish from. Tom never would allow Bob to accompany him on a fishing\n",
      "expedition, because he was afraid that if he became frolicsome he might\n",
      "upset the boat. One beautiful morning in summer, however, as Tom was\n",
      "preparing to row out to catch fish, Bob howled so piteously that Tom\n",
      "found it hard to leave the shore without him. Three times he threw him\n",
      "out of the boat, but it was all in vain: Bob had made up his mind to go\n",
      "in the boat, and so he went. They had been in their little dory about\n",
      "two hours when the wind changed, the sky darkened, and a storm began to\n",
      "loom in the distance. Tom was not afraid of it. He had been in storms\n",
      "before. The storm, however, began to increase in velocity. The wind\n",
      "howled, and the waves grew bigger and bigger. Tom began to pull towards\n",
      "the shore. Bob did not seem quite so comfortable. He was being tossed\n",
      "from side to side; but he kept his large brown eyes firmly fixed on\n",
      "Tom except for an occasional shake of the head when the spray of the\n",
      "tumbling water splashed his glossy ears. As the wind increased and the\n",
      "waves mounted higher, Tom began to feel a little nervous, for there\n",
      "was still half a mile between him and the shore. He continued to tug\n",
      "at the oars, and admonished the dog to “keep still.” “It’s all right,\n",
      "Bob,” said the boy. It was not all right, and the dog seemed to think\n",
      "so. In a few moments the inevitable happened. A huge wave switched the\n",
      "boat on to its side, and it failed to right itself again, Tom and Bob\n",
      "were pitched into the sea, and the boat quickly drifted out of reach.\n",
      "Tom saw that it was now a matter of life or death. Being an excellent\n",
      "swimmer, and seeing that it was useless to try to regain the boat,\n",
      "he struck out with might and main for the shore. A great difficulty\n",
      "confronted him, however, for the dog whined and struck out madly at him\n",
      "with his paws. “Get away, Bob; you’ll drown me!” shouted Tom. But Bob\n",
      "only howled all the more, as he splashed round the heels of his little\n",
      "master. Tom continued to strike out for land, kicking the dog’s head\n",
      "whenever he could. Bob now came up to the boy’s shoulder, and struck\n",
      "him several times on the back, knocking him under water. Had the dog\n",
      "gone mad? thought Tom. What was he trying to do? If Tom could only have\n",
      "read his faithful dog’s mind!\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was now not more than fifty yards from the shore, but he was\n",
      "almost exhausted. Would he reach home again? While this thought flashed\n",
      "through his mind, he heard a voice from the shore shouting: “Put yer\n",
      "arm round ’is neck, Tom.” Tom immediately obeyed, and the dog’s whine\n",
      "changed into a joyous bark. In a few minutes the boy was safe on his\n",
      "native soil, with Bob dancing round, wagging his tail, and licking\n",
      "his little master’s face. Tom put his arms around the dog’s neck and\n",
      "whispered in his ear: “Thank you, Bobby. I shall understand you better\n",

      "but during the last fifteen years it has been prosecuted with such\n",
      "vigour that its value has increased from $1,581 in 1897 to $168,131 in\n",
      "1909. According to authentic records, the most commercially valuable\n",
      "whale, the _Balæna mysticetus_, disappeared from Newfoundland waters\n",
      "in 1850, and the fin-whales, bottle-noses, blue whales, hump-backs,\n",
      "and common rorquals were considered of no value for whalebone. Their\n",
      "yield of oil was not so abundant, and their pursuit in small boats was\n",
      "hazardous on account of their great activity when attacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the year 1880 harpoons were the weapons used in hunting the\n",
      "whale, but in that year a Norwegian sailor named Svend Foyn invented\n",
      "the harpoon gun, the explosive shells of which kill the whale\n",
      "instantly. It requires a great deal of skill on the part of the\n",
      "operator to force home the harpoon at the right time and in the right\n",
      "place, for the whales display more intelligence than one would expect\n",
      "from a monster so clumsy. Moreover, they are stalwart sea warriors,\n",
      "and never surrender until entirely played out. Frequently the hunters\n",
      "pursue them for miles, and are probably disappointed at last. A school\n",
      "of whales may be sighted a long distance off, and then the hunters\n",
      "make a dash for sport. On more than one occasion these sportsmen have\n",
      "reached the school a few moments too late, for with a splash and a\n",
      "plunge the whales have gone below, as if conscious that they were\n",
      "surrounded by an enemy thirsting for their blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the deck of the whaler is fixed a large and powerful windlass, which\n",
      "answers the same purpose as an angler’s rod and line. When the whale\n",
      "feels the effect of the shot he darts madly downwards, dragging with\n",
      "him several lengths of rope. He is then “played” until his strength\n",
      "appears to be spent. The crew then attach the rope to the windlass,\n",
      "and begin to haul the monster in. This act calls for very cautious\n",
      "performance, for the giant prey may suddenly take another spurt,\n",
      "hauling with him lengths of the rope once more. When he is at last\n",
      "beaten and lies a panting, puffing mass on the surface of the water, a\n",
      "small boat is sent out, from which he is given his death-blow by means\n",
      "of a small steel lance.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his watery slaughter-house the giant fish is led to the flensing\n",
      "slip, where the labour of cutting and carving begins. The flensing\n",
      "slip is a slanting wharf, up which the body of the whale is hauled by\n",
      "heavy chains and a windlass. The butchers then take their long knives\n",
      "and cut off the outer coat of blubber, which is from 18 inches to 2\n",
      "feet wide. Then great joints are cut up and passed through a machine\n",
      "that strips them into slices as thin as a quarter of an inch. The next\n",
      "operation is the drawing off of the oil by means of heated vats. When\n",
      "the oil has been extracted, the remains, instead of being left to rot\n",
      "in the sun, as formerly, are now manufactured into a guano to scatter\n",
      "across the cotton plantations of the Southern States of America. The\n",
      "“teeth” of the whale are washed and dried and packed ready for market.\n",
      "These “teeth” are the celebrated whalebone, for which there is always a\n",
      "ready market in all parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the flesh of the whale is not so marketable as the flesh of\n",
      "many other fishes, some of the joints are considered as delicate and\n",
      "tender as an English beefsteak. The people of the Orient think a slice\n",
      "of the whale’s tail a great delicacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will be the future of the whaling industry of Newfoundland it is\n",
      "not safe to predict, for the rorquals do not breed so abundantly as\n",

      "a great many years, but it may be that the energetic prosecution of\n",

      "wonderful birds, marvellous beasts and fishes, which they met in that\n",
      "part of the new Western world discovered by John Cabot and his West of\n",
      "England crews: soles three yards long, huge sea-cows with long white\n",

      "\n",
      "Among all these animals and fishes, none is more interesting than the\n",
      "hair-seal of the North Atlantic. The birth, habits, and migration of\n",
      "the seal are just as marvellous as any other branch of natural history.\n",
      "Centuries ago the seals could make their home near the coasts of\n",
      "Newfoundland, for there were no white men to molest their “ancient,\n",
      "solitary reign”; but during the last century they have fled before the\n",
      "gaff of the hunters to the waters far to the north of Labrador.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the North Atlantic are to be found about six varieties of seals,\n",
      "the most valuable variety commercially being the harp-seal. The young\n",
      "harps begin to put on fat from the moment of their birth, so that in\n",
      "less than a month one of these baby seals will weigh from 25 to 40\n",
      "pounds. They usually remain on the ice about twenty-five days before\n",
      "taking to the water, during which time they are fed by their mothers,\n",
      "who will sometimes travel ten miles in order to furnish their young\n",
      "with food. One of the most mysterious things, however, is that, even if\n",
      "the young are not fed by their mothers, they continue to put on fat. It\n",
      "may be that the old seals select a sheet of ice containing animalculæ,\n",
      "for the young are often observed to be sucking the ice in the absence\n",
      "of their mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hoods, or bladder-nose seals, are also very abundant. They are\n",
      "much older than the harps when caught, and always congregate to the\n",
      "north-east of the latter species. The method of despatching the young\n",
      "hoods is with the gaff, but the old hoods are usually killed with the\n",
      "gun. The old dog-hood is a valiant fighter for the young. It sometimes\n",
      "happens that eight or ten men are engaged endeavouring to kill the\n",
      "old dog-hood with gaffs or clubs. When the bladder is filled, it will\n",
      "resist any amount of beating on the head, and frequently the hood will\n",
      "bite off the end of his assailant’s gaff.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the advent of milder weather at the beginning of the year, great\n",
      "ice-fields are to be seen in the bays of Newfoundland, and also many\n",
      "miles out at sea. It is upon these “fields” that the seals bring forth\n",
      "their young, about the middle of February. And what pretty little\n",
      "children they are--such bright, pathetic eyes, lovely white coats, and\n",
      "graceful movements! Their cry resembles that of a new-born babe, and\n",
      "when a ship is in the midst of them at night, their childlike wailing\n",
      "is one of the weirdest sounds imaginable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sealing fleet which goes out from St. John’s usually comprises\n",
      "eighteen ships, and they leave port on the 10th or 12th of March.\n",
      "From start to finish they have to contend with very heavy ice, and\n",
      "frequently very cold and stormy weather. When the seals are sighted,\n",
      "which is usually on the east coast of Newfoundland, according to the\n",
      "direction in which the ice is driven by wind and current, the captain\n",
      "sends his hunters in various directions over the ice-floe. Sometimes\n",
      "the hunters will travel six or ten miles from the ship, but the\n",
      "“lookout” never loses sight of them unless a fog falls and obscures\n",
      "them from his view.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of thousands of these baby seals the hunters go forward\n",
      "with their gaffs, dealing death on every hand. A slight stroke on the\n",
      "nose is sufficient to despatch them, and in a short time the ice is\n",
      "one mass of lifeless bodies. The hunter then takes his sharp knife and\n",
      "“sculps” them, which is removing the pelt from the carcass. This pelt\n",
      "contains the fur and about two inches of fat. The carcass is left on\n",
      "the ice to be eaten by birds or fishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sculping is finished, the pelts are “laced” together, and\n",
      "towed by a rope to what is known to the hunters as a “pan,” which is\n",
      "marked by a flag of the ship to which the crew belong. When these are\n",
      "heaped together under the various flags, the ship steams around and\n",
      "takes them on board in the same manner that she would take on any cargo.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the captain thinks that it is impossible to increase the catch,\n",
      "or when he has sufficient on board, he steams back to St. John’s,\n",
      "where the pelts are taken out to pass through certain processes before\n",
      "becoming marketable. The fat is removed from the skin and rendered\n",
      "into oil, which is very pure and white, and the skins are sent to all\n",
      "parts of the world to be manufactured into cloaks, capes, and leather.\n",
      "Sometimes a ship will return with as many as 40,000 pelts, and a good\n",
      "“harvest” usually reaches a grand total of 350,000. Many years ago, in\n",
      "the days of sailing-vessels, the catches were much greater, the largest\n",

      "The Newfoundland seal-hunter is famous for his daring achievements. He\n",
      "runs from pan to pan over the loose floating ice, and seems to be quite\n",
      "unconscious of any impending peril. What a perilous pursuit it is,\n",
      "too! The hunters never know when some terrible blizzard or blinding\n",
      "snowstorm may suddenly come driving in from the north, or when a thick\n",

      "the ice killing the young seals one night, when a terrific blizzard\n",
      "suddenly sprang up and cut off their retreat to the ship. When the\n",
      "blizzard had spent its force, the poor hunters were found lifeless on\n",
      "the great stretch of snow-covered ice. They were taken by loving hands\n",
      "from the ice, wrapped in canvas, and placed on deck to be brought back\n",
      "for interment at St. John’s, the city from which they had set out\n",
      "only a few weeks before, with buoyant spirits and hopes of a “bumper”\n",
      "voyage. It was one of the gloomiest days in the history of St. John’s\n",

      "of the great Dominion of Canada, and the majority of boys will be\n",
      "surprised to hear that the coast of this little-known country is a\n",

      "The present inhabitants obtain a livelihood by fishing and hunting,\n",
      "and are really a peaceful people. Strange as it may seem, the best\n",
      "educated people in Labrador are the Eskimos, which is due solely to the\n",
      "untiring efforts of the Moravian missionaries. And when the inhabitants\n",

      "The life of the Eskimo boy is a very hard one, but in their own way\n",
      "the children enjoy themselves, and their days are not without pleasure\n",
      "and sunshine. The baby boys are carried in a bag on the backs of their\n",
      "mothers until they are able to eat a slice of walrus, and then they are\n",
      "put into a pair of trousers, which the mother makes from seal-skins.\n",

      "Before the Eskimo boys are very old, they are taught to repair tents,\n",
      "use an oar, cast a line, and handle a gun. In addition, they are taught\n",
      "how to drive a team of dogs across snow and ice, for dog-sleds in that\n",
      "far-off country take the place of trains, trams, and hansom-cabs.\n",
      "These dogs, however, are very treacherous. In appearance they are\n",
      "exactly like wolves, and are often as ferocious. Any strange animal is\n",
      "at once put to death by them. Domestic animals and farmyard stock are\n",
      "soon killed and devoured. At certain seasons of the year, too, they\n",
      "will snarl and snap at their owners. Quite recently a family of three\n",
      "were reported to have been killed outright by these savage brutes. It\n",
      "is expected that when the deer have been trained to do the work of\n",
      "these dogs, an effort will be made to exterminate the entire breed.\n",
      "It is astonishing, however, the amount of work the Eskimo dogs will\n",
      "accomplish. A good team will travel from six to ten miles an hour, and\n",
      "cover a distance of sixty miles in the day without showing fatigue.\n",

      "In the springtime the boys accompany their fathers on sealing\n",

      "seal pops his head above water, a bullet goes through it in a moment.\n",
      "One method of capturing the seals is to build a barricade of ice,\n",

      "romantic adventure in the far-off land towards which the billows\n",
      "rolled. His youth was spent at Oxford, where he became a popular\n",
      "figure in athletic circles. A surprising incident decided his future\n",
      "for him. One evening during his medical course he went by chance\n",
      "into the Tabernacle in East London, just at the time when Mr. Moody\n",
      "was conducting evangelistic services in England. Here he received a\n",
      "conviction that his own religious life was a humbug. He wrestled with\n",
      "that conviction until it led him to decide that he would go to Labrador\n",
      "as a missionary under the auspices of the Royal National Mission to\n",
      "Deep-Sea Fishermen. In 1892 he took charge of the little steamer\n",

      "“Modesty is a virtue of which the Eskimo dog is seldom guilty. I was\n",
      "visiting one day a bedridden patient. As the outer door opened, a\n",
      "fragrant scent as of a dinner preparing was wafted outward. Suddenly\n",
      "an avalanche swept me off my legs, and a pack of dogs, whisking the\n",

      "more so as each having burnt his nose in the boiling liquid attributed\n",

      "starting in the morning, the snow is covered with little icicles,\n",
      "formed by the midday sun melting the frozen surface. As this is apt to\n",
      "make the feet of the dogs bleed, they are shod with a bag of sealskin,\n",
      "tied round the ankle. Three small holes are cut for the claws. A pup\n",
      "shod for the first time holds up his paws in the air alternately, but\n",

      "however, bite at and eat the harness, especially of the dog in front\n",
      "of them. Mr. Young tells of a big dog which, though apparently always\n",
      "hard at work, never seemed to get tired like the rest. It always\n",

      "the driver’s approval. His suspicions, however, were aroused, and one\n",
      "day, cutting loose the trace, he fastened it by a single thread to the\n",

      "high on to the ledges of rock, only to be dragged off by the return\n",
      "wave and once more pounded on to the rocks. To avoid this, the brave\n",

      "their bleeding paws, and nails torn off in the unequal struggle. Yet\n",
      "they would at once return to the charge, and, waiting their chance,\n",
      "leap right over the breaking crest, and so get clear of the surf.\n",

      "The fishing industry has been remunerative for so many generations that little attention has been devoted to the possibilities of the soil, and probably the close proximity of Canada, and its popularity as a country of great rewards for emigrants who are prepared to till the soil, have tended to keep Newfoundland in the background as a suitable Colony for the agricultural emigrants from England and the Continent. \n",
